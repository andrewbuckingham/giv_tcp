These files should be placed in the repository root directory.

Current placeholders:
- icon.png: Missing (use GivEnergy logo or create custom)

The add-on will work without these files, but they improve the
appearance in the Home Assistant add-on store.

You can use the GivEnergy logo from:

Or create custom logos using the GivTCP branding.
